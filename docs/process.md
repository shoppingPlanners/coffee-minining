Perfect ðŸ‘Œ â€” before we jump into the next code step, letâ€™s lay out the **full structure of your project** so your team of 4 data science undergrads can follow it A â†’ Z like a roadmap.

---

# ðŸ“‚ Project Structure for *Predictive Health Risk Analysis*

## **1. Documentation**

* `README.md` â†’ short project intro, objectives, instructions to run.
* `SOW.docx` / `SOW.pdf` â†’ Statement of Work (background, scope, plan).
* `report/` â†’ final project report (with results, visuals, recommendations).
* `presentation.pptx` â†’ slides for final demo.

---

## **2. Data**

* `data/raw/` â†’ original dataset(s) (never modify these).
* `data/processed/` â†’ cleaned & preprocessed data ready for modeling.
* `data/external/` â†’ if you add extra datasets later (e.g., stress surveys, coffee studies).

---

## **3. Notebooks**

Organized by steps in the CRISP-DM / Data Mining process.

* `01_data_understanding.ipynb`
  Load dataset, check types, missing values, duplicates, distributions, data dictionary.

* `02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
  Cleaning (imputation, outliers), encoding categorical features, scaling, train/test split.

* `03_exploratory_analysis.ipynb`
  Correlation heatmaps, feature-target relationships, class imbalance checks, insights.

* `04_feature_engineering.ipynb`
  Create new features (e.g., sleep-to-stress ratio, coffee Ã— stress interaction).

* `05_model_building.ipynb`
  Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).

* `06_model_evaluation.ipynb`
  Compare models, confusion matrices, precision/recall/F1, ROC curves.

* `07_model_explainability.ipynb`
  SHAP/feature importance plots â†’ interpret lifestyle factors.

* `08_recommendation_engine.ipynb`
  Translate model insights into actionable recommendations.

* `09_final_pipeline.ipynb`
  Unified notebook with end-to-end pipeline (for demo & deployment).

---

## **4. Source Code (`src/`)**

Reusable Python scripts (instead of just notebooks):

* `src/data_preprocessing.py` â†’ functions for cleaning, encoding, scaling.
* `src/eda.py` â†’ reusable visualization & summary functions.
* `src/models.py` â†’ train/evaluate models.
* `src/recommendations.py` â†’ generate user-level health advice.
* `src/utils.py` â†’ logging, helpers, config.

---

## **5. Outputs**

* `outputs/figures/` â†’ plots (EDA, correlations, SHAP, etc.).
* `outputs/models/` â†’ saved models (`.pkl` or `.joblib`).
* `outputs/results/` â†’ evaluation metrics, comparison tables, reports.
* `outputs/reports/` â†’ auto-generated summaries (CSV/JSON).

---

## **6. Project Workflow (Team Roles)**

Each of the 4 team members can take responsibility for one main block:

1. **Data Lead** â†’ Data understanding + preprocessing pipeline.
2. **EDA & Feature Lead** â†’ EDA visuals + feature engineering.
3. **Modeling Lead** â†’ Model training, tuning, evaluation.
4. **Insights & Reporting Lead** â†’ Explainability (SHAP), recommendations, final report.

---

## **7. Deliverables**

* Cleaned dataset(s).
* Visual analysis (EDA + correlations).
* Predictive model with best accuracy.
* Explainability results (key factors).
* Recommendation engine (simple rule-based + model-informed).
* Final report + presentation.

---

âœ… This structure makes it **easy to manage**, **clear for lecturers**, and **teamwork-friendly**.

Do you want me to now start writing the **next notebook/code: `02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`** (with best practices â†’ handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and train/test split)?
